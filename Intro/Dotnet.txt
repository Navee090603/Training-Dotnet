c# vs .Net
CLR
Architecture of .Net Application


C#

Is a programming language
.Net is framwork for building application on windows

.Net includes CLR (Common Language Runtime) and Class Library (for building application)

CLR

In c or c++ we dont have any IL code 

But in java we have Byte code which converts the normal code into byte then it convert that into native code.

The idea from the java in Csharp we have CLR which is the application that placed inthe memory and coneverts the IL code into Native code
the process is called just in time JIT

Architecture 

At the higher level for build an application we have bulinding blocks called classes 

class ---> Data and Methods
Data ---> Also called attribute and this is the state of the application.
Methods ---> Also called Functions and this is the behaviours they execute code  and do things for ourself.
