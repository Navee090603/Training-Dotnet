goto ---> is like a loop like method used.
----------------------------------------
Arrays : Arrays are continuous memory allocation of the same type with a fixed size and are reference types.

Types : Single Dimension, Two or Multi, Jagged Array.
----------------------------------------

Instance member : are members that are available as a copy to each and every object that is created.
                  They are accessed only with the object reference

Static Members: are known as class members
                  only one copy exists for the entire class
                  they are managed and maintained by the CLR
                  are accessed only with the class name.

-----------------------------------------
Strings: 

- are a collection of characters
- are predefined reference types
- memory is allocated on the heap
- strings have fixed size
- strings are immutable
- strings memory cannot be changed

String Builders : Same as String but mutable.

-----------------------------------------

Structures and Enumeration 

 Structures : are user defined value types
             are used to create and store multiple data of different data types as a single unit

Enumerations : are a set/collection of named constants
               are user defined value types
               are declared using Enum keyword
               the default type of any enumeration list is int
               is used when we want to store a list of values that generally correspond to a particular type

-----------------------------------------
ReadOnly : variables/fields that are declared using 'readonly' keyword
           They cannot be modified after they are initialized
           We can initialize readonly variables either at the time of declaration or thru a constructor
           Constructor initializations have precedence
           They are similar to non-static members(meaning, it is maintained as a separate copy in each object)
           While the non-static members values can be changed by the object, the same is not possible with readonly


Constants  : are like readonly (meaning once initialized cannot be modified)
             Unlike readonly we can initialize the constants only at the time of declaration
             Are like static members because there exists only one copy of the constant for the entire class
             While static members can be changed, constants cannot be
