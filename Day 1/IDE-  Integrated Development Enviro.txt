IDE-  Integrated Development Environment VS2019
For .NET Framework

Not a Cross-Platform only .NET core is cross platform
Only runs on windows platform
Software components that provide tools and library, that enables developers to create software much easier and faster (RAD).

Architecture is a ---> "layered one" for .NET (7 layers)

1. Language Independent
2. WinForms {WPF - Windows Presentation Framework, Silverlight, ASP.Net}
3. WCF and WWF (Communication And Work Flow)
4. ADO.net, LINQ, XML (Data Tier)
5. Base Class Library {Framework Class Library}
6. CLR
7. OS

1)
source code ---> compiler ---> Executable/native code ---> operating system

2)
source code ---> compiler ---> "Intermediate code" [Common Language Runtime] [Just in time(JIT) compiler]---> Executable/native code ---> operating system

Points to Remember

IL also know as CIL/MSIL/Managed code --->  unmanaged code managed by OS
Assembly Files are fundamental unit of deployment, Version Control, and reusable, .net application.
That are 2 types EXE file or DLL
	- Consists of IL, Manifest File -> Metadata, PE (portable executable) Header, CLR Header
	- can be private or shared

In conclusion dotnet is the Microsoft web services strategy to connect information, people, systems and devices through software.

Desktop - deployed in each machine (Console,Windows)
Web Application - Internet based application accessed through browsers (Asp.Net winforms,Asp.Net core and Asp.Net)
Mobile - Xamarin
